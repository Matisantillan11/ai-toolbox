name: create-pr
description: Creates a GitHub pull request with a fully auto-populated standardized template. Infers the base branch, derives the description from the diff and commits, detects shared code impact, tags stakeholders from CODEOWNERS, and builds a concrete test plan from the changes. Designed to run without human input when called by an agent, or with a confirmation step when invoked directly.

# create-pr

**Role:** Senior engineer opening a pull request.  
**Goal:** Auto-generate a complete, reviewer-ready PR from git context alone. Every section is derived from the diff, commits, branch name, and project files — no manual writing required. When `--auto` is passed (or when called by another skill/agent), skip all confirmation steps and create the PR immediately.

---

## Step 1 — Parse arguments

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for:
- `--base <branch>` — target branch for the PR (skip inference if provided)
- `--ticket-id <id>` — ClickUp or issue ID to reference (optional)
- `--auto` — skip all confirmation steps and create the PR without asking

Capture any provided values. Set `AUTO_MODE = true` if `--auto` is present.

---

## Step 2 — Gather git context

Run all commands via Bash. Capture every output — it feeds every section of the template.

```bash
# Current branch
git branch --show-current

# Remote URL (to extract OWNER and REPO)
git remote get-url origin

# Current git user email (to exclude from FYI tagging)
git config user.email

# All remote branches (for base branch inference)
git branch -r --format='%(refname:short)' | sed 's/origin\///'

# Last 20 commits on this branch (used for description and module inference)
git log HEAD --oneline -20

# All changed files vs each candidate base branch (resolved once base is confirmed)
# Run after base is resolved:
git diff <BASE_BRANCH>...HEAD --name-only
git diff <BASE_BRANCH>...HEAD --stat
git diff <BASE_BRANCH>...HEAD
```

Extract `OWNER` and `REPO` from the remote URL:
- SSH: `git@github.com:owner/repo.git`
- HTTPS: `https://github.com/owner/repo.git`

If the working tree has uncommitted changes, warn:
> "Uncommitted changes detected. These will not be included in the PR. Commit them first or proceed anyway."
In `AUTO_MODE`, proceed without asking.

---

## Step 3 — Infer the base branch

If `--base` was provided, use it as `BASE_BRANCH` without any confirmation or inference and skip to Step 4. This is always correct when called by `implement-task` — do not second-guess it.

Otherwise, infer from the remote branches list using this priority order:

1. `main`
2. `master`
3. `develop`
4. `staging`
5. First `release/*` branch found
6. If none of the above exist, use the most recently committed remote branch

If `AUTO_MODE` is false and the inferred branch is not `main` or `master`, confirm with the user:
> "Inferred base branch: `<branch>`. Is this correct?"
In `AUTO_MODE`, proceed with the inferred branch silently.

If the current branch equals `BASE_BRANCH`, stop:
> "The current branch is the same as the base branch. Switch to a feature branch first."

---

## Step 4 — Infer PR title

Derive the PR title from the branch name:
1. Strip the type prefix: `feat/`, `fix/`, `chore/`, `refactor/`, `docs/`, `hotfix/`
2. Strip any ticket/sprint/module prefix (e.g. `CU-abc123-`, `M3-S12-`)
3. Replace hyphens and underscores with spaces
4. Title-case the result
5. Prepend the type label in brackets: `[Feature]`, `[Fix]`, `[Refactor]`, `[Docs]`, `[Chore]`, `[Hotfix]`
6. If a ticket ID is available (from `--ticket-id` or extracted from the branch name), append it: `(CU-abc123)`

Example: `feat/CU-abc123-user-auth-flow` → `[Feature] User auth flow (CU-abc123)`

---

## Step 5 — Populate the PR template

Populate every section below by analyzing the git context from Step 2. Instructions inside each section describe how to derive the content — follow them precisely. The rendered output must not contain the instruction text.

---

### Section: Description

Using the commit messages and `git diff` output:

- Write 2–4 bullet points summarising the "Why" (motivation / problem solved) and "What" (what was changed at a high level)
- Every bullet must start with exactly one of these semantic keywords: `add`, `update`, `fix`, `refactor`, `delete`
- Do not paste raw commit messages — rewrite them as coherent intent statements
- Be specific: reference function names, component names, or API routes where relevant

---

### Section: Module

Parse the branch name and the last 20 commit messages for:

- **Migration Number / Section Name** — look for patterns like `M1`, `M2`, `M3`, `migration-1`, `section-2` in the branch name or commits. Extract as `M{N}`. If not found, write `<!-- TBD -->`.
- **Sprint** — look for patterns like `S12`, `sprint-12`, `sprint/12` in the branch name or commits. Extract as `S{N}`. If not found, write `<!-- TBD -->`.

Never invent values. Placeholders are correct when data is absent.

---

### Section: Shared Code Impact

Inspect the list of changed files (`git diff --name-only`) for any files inside directories that suggest shared or cross-cutting code:

- Common directory names: `shared/`, `core/`, `common/`, `lib/`, `utils/`, `helpers/`, `hooks/`, `composables/`, `services/`, `types/`, `constants/`

If any matches are found:
- Answer: **Yes**
- List each affected file path
- Add: `Team notified: No` (the author must verify before merge)

If no matches: Answer: **No**

---

### Section: FYI

1. Check if a `CODEOWNERS` file exists at the project root or `.github/CODEOWNERS`.  
   If it exists, read it and extract GitHub handles (`@username`) mapped to the changed files.

2. Also run:
   ```bash
   git log <BASE_BRANCH>...HEAD --invert-grep -E --format="%ae" -- <changed files> | sort | uniq
   ```
   Map contributor emails to GitHub handles where possible (use the handle from CODEOWNERS if the same person appears there).

3. Combine both sources into a de-duplicated list of `@handles`.

4. **Mandatory:** remove the current PR author's handle from the list (identified by `git config user.email` from Step 2).

5. If the list is empty after deduplication, write: `No additional stakeholders identified.`

---

### Section: Screenshots

Inspect the changed file paths for UI indicators:
- Directories: `pages/`, `views/`, `routes/`, `screens/`, `app/`, `src/app/`
- File extensions or names containing: `.vue`, `.svelte`, `Page.`, `View.`, `Screen.`, `Layout.`
- Any component file touched inside a route-level directory

**If UI changes are detected:**
- List each modified route or page
- For each, provide the GitHub raw URL format for evidence screenshots:
  ```
  https://github.com/<OWNER>/<REPO>/blob/<CURRENT_BRANCH>/.github/evidence/<filename>.png?raw=true
  ```
- Note: "Add screenshots at the paths above before requesting review."

**If no UI changes:** write: `No UI changes in this PR.`

---

### Section: Test Plan

Derive a concrete, ordered checkbox list a reviewer can follow to verify the changes end-to-end.

Rules:
- Every step must come from the actual diff — no generic steps like "verify the app works"
- Start from the entry point a real user or caller would use (navigate to a route, call an endpoint, trigger an action)
- Cover the happy path first, then at least one edge or error case if changes touch validation, error handling, or conditional logic
- Include any required setup (env vars, feature flags, seed data, running migrations)
- One action per checkbox — short and imperative
- If the change is backend-only: describe the API call (method, endpoint, payload, expected response)
- If the change is UI-only: describe the user interaction and the expected visual or functional outcome
- If new tests were added: include a step to run them with the specific command (e.g. `npm test -- --testPathPattern=<file>`)

Format:
```
- [ ] <imperative step>
- [ ] <imperative step>
```

---

### Section: Release Readiness

- `Ready for release:` Yes — if all test plan steps are expected to pass based on the implementation
- `Needs additional work:` No — unless there are known gaps, open questions, or incomplete items identified during implementation

---

## Step 6 — Render and confirm

Assemble the full PR body using this exact structure:

```markdown
### Description 📝
<populated description bullets>

### Module
- Migration: <M{N} or TBD>
- Sprint: <S{N} or TBD>

### Shared Code Impact
<Yes/No + file list or "No">
Team notified: <Yes/No>

### FYI 🙋
<@handles or "No additional stakeholders identified.">

### Screenshots 📸
<screenshot entries or "No UI changes in this PR.">

### Test Plan 🧪
<checkbox list>

### Release Readiness
- Ready for release: <Yes/No>
- Needs additional work: <Yes/No>
```

If `AUTO_MODE` is **false**, present the rendered body and the inferred title to the user and ask:
> "Does this PR look correct? Reply Yes to create it, or paste corrections."
Apply any corrections before proceeding.

If `AUTO_MODE` is **true**, skip confirmation and proceed immediately.

---

## Step 7 — Create the PR

```
mcp__github__create_pull_request {
  owner: "<OWNER>",
  repo: "<REPO>",
  title: "<PR title>",
  body: "<rendered PR body>",
  head: "<current branch>",
  base: "<BASE_BRANCH>"
}
```

---

## Step 8 — Report

```
## Pull Request Created

Title:  <title>
URL:    <pr_url>
Base:   <BASE_BRANCH> <- <current branch>
Files:  <count> changed
```

Store `PR_URL` and `PR_NUMBER` in context — downstream skills or agents may need them.
